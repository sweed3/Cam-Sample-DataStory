          <p class="lead">Spending disparities between school districts are significant. Given a few districts' greater costs, their money is insufficient to achieve the statewide average student performance level. Edsight, Connecticut's official source for educational data, reports that Sharon Public Schools spends a whopping $45,587 per student, opposed to Danbury Public Schools' $13,972 per pupil expenditure. To assure that every district is financially capable of attaining a specific performance target, a significant increase in education spending is necessary. Furthermore, the financial performance of a district in Connecticut's school system is evaluated by a formula known as "per pupil expenditures." Principally, per pupil expenditure (PPE) is calculated by dividing the amount of money spent on students by a district in a given year by the number of students in that district. Our community partners have asked Professor Dougherty’s data visualization team to determine how per-pupil spending varies for every school district in the greater Hartford area and how they have fluctuated over time. More specifically, they want us to do research and provide insightful data visualizations on a severe issue that draws more attention to the notable spending disparities among school systems in the Greater Hartford area. Further, through data research, I will highlight expenditure differentials influencing educational inequality by evaluating each district's PPE over a four-year span. p>

          <p>Figure 1: Explore the <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uGDyO/5/">Interactive chart</a>. Mean PPE for Districts in the Greater Hartford Region.</p>
     
          <p>Chart 1 uncovers the large spending gap between districts in the Hartford area. The top spender, CREC, is nearly twice as much as the lowest spender, Jumoke Academy District. Notably, according to this bar chart, the schools with the highest PPE in the Hartford area are located in the northern part. As we look closer, it’s evident that charter school districts are located at the bottom of the chart. Connecticut utilizes five different formulas for magnet schools, two different formulas for charter schools, and additional methods for the Open Choice program, agriscience programs, and the Connecticut Technical Education and Career System.
Only the Education Cost Sharing (ECS) formula and the state charter school formula take into, account the student learning needs while determining how much money should be allocated to a given school district. Consequently, thousands of Connecticut students who attend other types of public schools are not funded by a formula that accounts for their learning needs. Instead, flat-dollar subsidies are used to pay for these students, who are predominantly students of color.</p>

    </div>
            <p>In Chart 2, almost all school districts in Greater Hartford experience an increase in their PPE. It’s evident that the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund was a driving factor in this positive jump of change in PPE. Congress appropriated $189 billion to the ESSER Fund in March 2020 as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. In doing so, three COVID-19 stimulus packages were utilized: (1) the CARES Act (ESSER I); (2) the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act (ESSER II); and (3) the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act (ESSER III). Connecticut has received nearly $1.7 billion of the $189 billion in ESSER funding. Inevitably, this positive change in PPE is not sustainable and will certainly take a deep dive into the near future. 
Furthermore, the 36 of school districts looked at, only one, Achievement First Hartford Academy, decreased their PPE from 2017 to 2021, discounting this short-lived upward trend. WHY?</p>
